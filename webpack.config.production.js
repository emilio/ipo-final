/**
 * WEBPACK CONFIG
 *
 * Notes on config properties:
 *
 * 'entry'
 * Entry point for the bundle.
 *
 * 'output'
 * If you pass an array - the modules are loaded on startup. The last one is exported.
 *
 * 'resolve'
 * Array of file extensions used to resolve modules.
 *
 * devtool: 'eval-source-map'
 * http://www.cnblogs.com/Answer1215/p/4312265.html
 * The source map file will only be downloaded if you have source maps enabled and your dev tools open.
 *
 * OccurrenceOrderPlugin
 * Assign the module and chunk ids by occurrence count. Ids that are used often get lower (shorter) ids.
 * This make ids predictable, reduces to total file size and is recommended.
 *
 * UglifyJsPlugin
 * Minimize all JavaScript output of chunks. Loaders are switched into minimizing mode.
 *    - 'compress'
 *      Compressor is a tree transformer which reduces the code size by applying various optimizations on the AST.
 *
 * 'NODE_ENV'
 * React relies on process.env.NODE_ENV based optimizations.
 * If we force it to production, React will get in an optimized manner.
 * This will disable some checks (eg. property type checks) and give you a smaller build and improved performance.
 *    Note: That JSON.stringify is needed as webpack will perform string replace "as is".
 *    In this case we'll want to end up with strings as that's what various comparisons expect, not just production.
 *    Latter would just cause an error.
 *
 * 'babel'
 * Babel enables the use of ES6 today by transpiling your ES6 JavaScript into equivalent ES5 source
 * that is actually delivered to the end user browser.
